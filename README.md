## üö¶ Prerequisites

- [**MPI**](https://www.mpich.org/static/downloads/4.0.2/mpich-4.0.2-installguide.pdf)
- [**Parallel HDF5**](https://support.hdfgroup.org/documentation/hdf5/latest/_cookbook.html)
- [**ScaLAPACK**](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl-download.html)

## ‚ö° Usage Instructions

### üõ†Ô∏è Force Constant Generation

1. **Prepare a LAMMPS input file.**
2. **Install the serial LAMMPS Python wrapper.**  
   _(MPI Python wrapper is not supported.)_  
   See the [LAMMPS documentation](https://docs.lammps.org/Python_install.html) for installation instructions.
3. **Generate the force constants:**

   ```bash
   mpiexec -np <no. of cores> Force_Constant_Generation/get_force_constant.py -i <LAMMPS input file> -o <output file> -d <displacement>
   ```

### üéµ Phonon Frequency Calculation

1. **Build the code:**
   ```bash
   make -f Makefile.<dist>   # supported: Intel MKL, AOCL
   ```
   _Tip: Use the `-D__DEBUG` flag for debugging (generates large log files)._  
   
   üí° **Note:**
   - In the `Makefile.intel` (if building with INTEL compilers), you can change the Fortran compiler to the appropriate compiler wrapped with HDF5.
   - If you are using native Fortran compilers, make sure to link the HDF5 libraries separately.
   - Change the `Makefile.aocl` appropriately for AOCC compilers.
   - You can also build the code with any other compiler of your choice. To do that, copy one of the provided Makefiles and replace the Fortran compiler (`FC`) with the compiler of your choice. Put the paths to the BLAS, LAPACK, and ScaLAPACK libs in `BLAS_LIBS`, `LAPACK_LIBS`, and `SCALAPACK_LIBS` respectively. Also update your Fortran compiler flags (`FCFLAGS`) and the linked library flags (`FLFLAGS`) appropriately. Then build with the Makefile.

2. **Prepare a q-point file** using the Utilities folder examples.  
   _See the Utilities/README for details._  
   You can use `Utilities/Examples/gen_band_q_pt.py` and `Utilities/Examples/gen_dos_q_pt.py` as examples for generating q-points along high-symmetry lines and across the BZ, respectively.

3. **Create an input file** for the phonon code. Use the following template:

   ```
   # ---------------------------------------------------
   # Input file for Phonon Calculations in Moire Systems
   # ---------------------------------------------------

   # LAMMPS Structure

   lammps file location         :

                                                           # I = compute eigenvalues from min index to max index
                                                           # V = compute eigenvalues from a min-max range
   min eigval                   :                          # Minimum value of the eigenvalue to be found, ignored if compute eigvecs = A/I
   max eigval                   :                          # Maximum value of the eigenvalue to be found, ignored if compute eigvecs = A/I

                                                           # CD = Dynamical matrix derivatives generated from central differences
